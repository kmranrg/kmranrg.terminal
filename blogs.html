                                When I landed in the USA, my first big purchase wasn’t a car or furniture—it was a bike. That bike became my freedom on wheels and my favorite way to explore. I liked the wind pushing my bike and the splatter of dirt reminding me that life is beautifully messy—and fun.
                                This picture captures one of those rides—goofy, gritty, and full of joy. Sometimes, the simplest things, like a bike and a clear sky, teach you the most about freedom, perseverance, and how to avoid potholes. So, hop on a bike and let the wind be your cheerleader—you might just pedal into your best stories.

                                After six long years, I was finally heading back to my village—a place I had missed dearly. Life and, of course, COVID had kept me away, but now, the wait was over.
                                This picture captures the moment before the flight, standing in anticipation. I could almost smell the earthy aroma of the soil, hear the melodious chirping of the birds in the morning, and taste the pure, authentic flavors of village food that I had missed all these years. It's funny how something as simple as freshly cooked dal or warm rotis can hold so much nostalgia.
                                The journey wasn’t just about getting back—it was about reconnecting. Reconnecting with my roots, with the simplicity of village life, and with memories that never fade. They say the heart always knows where home is, and mine? It was already there, soaking in the peace and beauty of the village, long before I even arrived.
