Adding Blogs:

1) Open `blogs.html` and go to "<div class="terminal-body">" section.
2) Add your blog just below this, make sure your blog ids are in descending order.
3) Now, open `blogs_script.js` and go to "document.querySelector('#blog3 .clickable-title h2 > span').classList.add('rotate');" and update your blog number in "#blog<num>".
4) There you go, all done!
5) Don't forget to remove active class from the previous blog and add to the new one.
6) Now, you're done!
